### 1. Analysis of electricity payment mechanism and financial impact

#### a. Electricity payment mechanism
Based on the information you provide:
- **Advance partner**: You pay the electricity bill to EVN within **10 days** of receiving the bill (usually once a month).
- **VinFast refund**: VinFast (V-Green) refunds the electricity bill after **15 days** of submitting the bill to them. However, there is a risk of late refund.
- **Payment cycle**:
- Suppose the electricity bill for January is on February 5, you must pay EVN before February 15.
- You send the bill to VinFast on February 5, VinFast refunds around February 20 (if on time).
- If VinFast is late (e.g. 30-60 days), you will have to wait until March or April to receive the refund.

- **Working capital requirement**: Brokers advise preparing cash for 2-3 months of electricity bills because:

- You must pay in advance for electricity for the current month (January) and possibly the next month (February) before receiving a refund from VinFast.

- If VinFast is late in refunding, you need enough cash to pay the March bill to avoid being cut off by EVN or fined for late payment.

#### b. Estimated electricity costs and working capital to prepare
Based on FAST+'s quote (6 120kW charging stations) and broker information saying that electricity costs can be up to **1 billion VND/month**:

- **Assumed electricity costs**:

- Number of charging vehicles/day: 100 vehicles (with 6 stations, each station serves ~16-17 vehicles/day).
- Electricity consumption/vehicle: 50 kWh (average for VinFast electric vehicles).
- Business electricity price: 4,500 VND/kWh (average, including 50% peak hours 4,937 VND/kWh, 50% normal hours 2,870 VND/kWh, plus 10% loss).
- Electricity consumption/month: 100 vehicles * 50 kWh * 30 days = **150,000 kWh**.
- Electricity cost: 150,000 kWh * 4,500 VND = **675 million VND/month**.
- **If reaching 1 billion VND/month** (as the broker said):
- Need 150 vehicles/day: 150 vehicles * 50 kWh * 30 days = 225,000 kWh.
- Electricity cost: 225,000 kWh * 4,500 VND = **1.0125 billion VND/month**.

- Or higher electricity price (5,000 VND/kWh): 150,000 kWh * 5,000 VND = **750 million VND/month**, plus capacity fee (50-250 million VND/month) to reach 1 billion VND.

- **Working capital to prepare**:

- For 2 months: 675 million * 2 = **1.35 billion VND** (or 1 billion * 2 = **2 billion VND** if reaching the broker's level).

- For 3 months: 675 million * 3 = **2.025 billion VND** (or 1 billion * 3 = **3 billion VND**).

- With the risk of late payment from VinFast, you need **2-3 billion VND in cash** to advance, ensuring liquidity in the first 2-3 months.

#### c. Financial impact
- **Liquidity pressure**:
- With an initial investment of VND 2.87 billion (according to FAST+ quotation), you need an additional VND 2-3 billion to advance the electricity bill, a total of VND 4.87-5.87 billion** in the first 2-3 months.
- If you borrow the entire amount (VND 4-5 billion as you mentioned), the interest rate of 10%/year = VND 33-42 million/month will increase financial pressure, especially if VinFast is slow to refund.
- **Risk of delayed refund**:
- If VinFast is slow to refund the electricity bill (30-60 days), you may lack cash to pay the next month's bill, leading to the risk of being cut off or fined by EVN.
- This is especially dangerous if the revenue from charging (VND 750/kWh) is not enough to cover other operating costs (land rent, personnel, maintenance).
- **Revenue from charging**:
- With 100 vehicles/day, 50 kWh/vehicle, revenue = 100 * 50 * 750 VND * 30 = **112.5 million VND/month**.

- With 150 vehicles/day: 150 * 50 * 750 VND * 30 = **168.75 million VND/month**.

- Compared to other operating costs (land rent 10-20 million, maintenance 15 million, personnel 20 million, infrastructure fee 30 million = **75-100 million VND/month**), net profit is only about **12.5-93.75 million VND/month**, not enough to cover loan interest or electricity advance costs if VinFast is late in paying.

---

### 2. Answering questions about VinFast franchise model and independent stations

#### a. Why do VinFast franchise stations charge less but are still popular?

- **Reasons for low profits**:

- VinFast (V-Green) keeps most of the revenue from charging prices (VND 3,858/kWh), only sharing **VND 750/kWh** (19%) with partners to offset network investment, technology, and operating costs.

- However, VinFast bears the cost of electricity (although you have to pay in advance), reducing the long-term financial burden compared to independent stations, where you have to pay for electricity yourself (VND 4,500/kWh).

- **Why are they still popular?**:

- **Comprehensive support**: VinFast takes care of maintenance, management software, marketing, and legal (electrical connection, fire protection), reducing risks and costs for partners.
- **High vehicle traffic**: VinFast has >90% market share of electric vehicles in Vietnam (more than 20,000 vehicles delivered in the first 6 months of 2024), ensuring 100-150 vehicles/day in good locations, creating stable cash flow (VND 112.5-168.75 million/month).

- **Incentive policy**: Free charging until mid-2027 to attract customers, increase charging traffic. V-Green can waive some operating costs (such as maintenance) in the initial phase.

- **Indirect benefits**: Charging stations at cafes, restaurants, or rest stops generate additional revenue from customers using other services.
- **Role of broker/installer (FAST+)**:

- **Not a scam**: FAST+ makes money from selling equipment (VND 2,496 billion for 6 charging stations) and installation services (VND 374 million), but they provide VinFast-standard equipment and technical support.

- **Why not build the station yourself?**:

- **Lack of ecosystem**: FAST+ does not have an electric vehicle network, application, or marketing like VinFast, making it difficult for independent stations to attract customers.

- **High risk**: Operating an independent station requires large capital, marketing costs, and faces competition from VinFast (a network of 150,000 charging ports).

- **Focus on expertise**: FAST+ specializes in providing equipment and installation, not wanting to take on long-term operational risks.
- **Comments**: Brokers may exaggerate profits or not explain clearly the mechanism of electricity advance payment, making you suspicious. However, it is reasonable to prepare 2-3 months of electricity bill to avoid liquidity risk.

#### b. Is VinFast charging port different from other electric vehicles? Can other vehicles be charged?

- **Differences in charging port**:

- **VinFast**: Standard **CCS2** (DC fast charging) and **Type 2** (AC slow charging), popular in Europe and compatible with many electric vehicles.

- **Other vehicles**:
- **BYD, Hyundai, Kia**: Use CCS2 and Type 2, compatible with VinFast pillars.

- **Chinese vehicles (Xpeng, Haima)**: Mainly use CCS2, but some use **GB/T** (not directly compatible).

- **Tesla**: Use **NACS**, but can use adapter to charge CCS2.
- **Nissan Leaf**: Use **CHAdeMO** (not compatible with CCS2).
- **Can other cars be charged at VinFast stations?**:
- **Technical**: Cars using CCS2 (BYD, Hyundai, Kia, Tesla with adapter) can be charged at VinFast stations.
- **Policy**: V-Green limits only VinFast cars to be charged at franchise stations via the management system (app, charging card). Other cars will have difficulty accessing unless V-Green expands its policy in the future.
- **Impact on independent stations**:
- Independent stations can install CCS2, GB/T, or CHAdeMO ports to charge many types of cars, but the non-VinFast car market is too small (a few thousand cars compared to tens of thousands of VinFast cars).
- BYD and Hyundai car owners often charge at home (AC 7.4kW) to save money (VND 1,746/kWh off-peak hours compared to VND 7,900-9,900/kWh at public stations), reducing the need to charge at independent stations.
#### c. Is an independent station more feasible than a VinFast franchise?

- **Theoretical advantages of an independent station**:

- **Higher revenue**: Charging price 7,900-9,900 VND/kWh (compared to 750 VND/kWh of a franchise), increasing profit per kWh.

- **Multiple compatibility**: Can serve BYD, Hyundai, Kia, Tesla, or Chinese cars (if installing a GB/T port).

- For example: With 50 cars/day, 50 kWh/car, price 9,900 VND/kWh, revenue = 50 * 50 * 9,900 * 30 = **742.5 million VND/month**. Minus electricity costs (VND 4,500/kWh) = 50 * 50 * 4,500 * 30 = VND 337.5 million, profit before other costs ≈ **VND 405 million/month**, higher than franchising.
- **Actual risks**:
- **Few non-VinFast vehicles**: VinFast accounts for >90% of the Vietnamese electric vehicle market share. Other brands (BYD, Hyundai) only have a few thousand vehicles, not enough to ensure 50 vehicles/day.
- **Home charging behavior**: Electric vehicle owners prefer to charge at home at night (low electricity prices), reducing the need for public charging for non-VinFast vehicles.
- **Strong competition**: VinFast has 150,000 charging ports, integrated maps and applications, plus a free charging policy until 2027, making it difficult for independent stations to attract customers.
- **High operating costs**: Independent stations must pay for their own electricity (VND 4,500/kWh), maintenance, marketing, and toll collection management, increasing costs compared to franchises (VinFast takes care of electricity and maintenance).

- **Legal and technical**: Independent stations need to handle their own electrical connections, fire protection, and meet standards (ISO-15118, IEC 61851), which is time-consuming and costly.

- **VinFast franchise is more feasible because**:

- **High traffic volume**: 100-150 vehicles/day is feasible in good locations (highways, industrial parks), generating stable revenue (VND 112.5-168.75 million/month).

- **Electricity cost support**: VinFast covers the electricity bill, reducing long-term burden, even though you have to pay 2-3 months in advance.

- **Integrated ecosystem**: Franchise stations are promoted through the VinFast app, vehicle maps, and marketing campaigns, ensuring a stable number of customers.

- **Lower risk**: V-Green takes care of maintenance, legal, and technology, reducing costs and risks compared to independent stations.

---

### 3. Re-analyze operating costs (with new electricity payment mechanism)
Based on FAST+ quotation (VND 2.87 billion for 6 120kW charging stations) and VinFast's electricity payment mechanism:

- **Initial investment cost**: VND 2.87 billion (main equipment VND 2.496 billion + materials/installation VND 374 million).

- **Operating cost/month** (excluding electricity, because VinFast pays):

- Rent: VND 10-20 million.

- Maintenance: VND 15 million.
- Personnel: 20 million VND (2-3 employees, 7-10 million/person).
- Infrastructure fee (transformer station, capacity fee): 30 million VND.
- **Total**: 75-85 million VND/month.
- **Working capital to prepare**:
- Advance electricity payment (2-3 months): **1.35-2.025 billion VND** (assuming 675 million VND/month) or **2-3 billion VND** (if 1 billion VND/month as the broker said).
- Total capital needed: 2.87 billion (investment) + 1.35-3 billion (electricity bill) + 75-85 million (first month's operation) ≈ **4.3-5.96 billion VND** in the first 2-3 months.
- **Revenue/month**:
- 100 vehicles/day, 50 kWh/vehicle: 100 * 50 * 750 VND * 30 = **112.5 million VND**.
- 150 vehicles/day: 150 * 50 * 750 VND * 30 = **168.75 million VND**.
- **Net profit/month**:
- With 100 vehicles/day: 112.5 - 75-85 = **27.5-37.5 million VND**.
- With 150 vehicles/day: 168.75 - 75-85 = **83.75-93.75 million VND**.
- **Payback period** (excluding interest):

- With an investment of 2.87 billion VND:

- 100 vehicles/day: 2,870 / 27.5-37.5 ≈ **77-104 months** (6.4-8.7 years).

- 150 vehicles/day: 2,870 / 83.75-93.75 ≈ **31-34 months** (2.6-2.8 years).

- **Interest impact** (if borrowing 4-5 billion VND, interest rate 10%/year):

- Interest: 33-42 million VND/month.

- Profit after interest:

- 100 vehicles/day: 27.5-37.5 - 33-42 = **loss of 4.5 million to profit of 4.5 million VND/month**.

- 150 cars/day: 83.75-93.75 - 33-42 = **41.75-60.75 million VND/month**.

- Long payback period if profit is low or loss.

---
### 4. Recommendations to reduce risks and overcome delays

#### a. Reduce financial risks
- **Negotiating with VinFast/V-Green**:
- Requesting a commitment to an exact electricity refund time (15 days) and a support policy if the refund is delayed (e.g., interest compensation for the advance payment).
- Asking about working capital support (free electricity for the first month or interest-free loan) to reduce liquidity pressure.
- **Negotiating with FAST+**:
- Verifying the electricity cost of VND 1 billion/month based on how many cars/day and charging station capacity. Requesting actual reports from similar stations.
- Negotiating a reduction in equipment price (VND 2.496 billion) or sharing installation costs (VND 374 million).
- **Choosing the optimal location**:
- Choosing an area with 100-150 VinFast cars/day (highways, industrial parks, commercial centers). Contact V-Green (hotline 1900 23 23 89) to get traffic data.

- Field survey: Count VinFast cars through the location for 1-2 days (or ask the group "VinFast Electric Vehicle Association" on Facebook).

- **Reduce borrowing**:

- Instead of borrowing 4-5 billion VND, borrow only 2-3 billion VND (enough for the investment cost of 2.87 billion). The rest is used from own capital or calling for partners to contribute capital.

- If you have to borrow, choose a long term (5-7 years) to reduce monthly interest (33-42 million VND).

- **Increase additional revenue**:

- Combine charging stations with coffee shops, car washes, or convenience stores to attract customers and increase income outside of charging.

#### b. Overcome procrastination
You are worried about financial pressure and responsibility to your neighbor, leading to delays in planning. Here is a specific action plan:

- **Today (1 hour)**:
- Call V-Green (1900 23 23 89) to ask:
- Electricity refund policy (time, risk of delayed refund).
- Traffic forecast at the location the neighbor chose (send coordinates or address).
- Support working capital or free first month.
- Note the answer to clarify the financial mechanism.
- **Tomorrow (2 hours)**:
- Contact FAST+ (hotline 0911 99 00 33) to:
- Verify electricity cost of 1 billion VND/month (number of vehicles, capacity, capacity fee).
- Request actual report from similar charging station (6 120kW poles).
- Negotiate equipment discount or share installation cost.
- Join the “VinFast Electric Vehicle Association” group on Facebook, ask about the actual traffic volume and operating costs from franchise station owners.
- **Within 3 days (3-4 hours)**:
- Write a short report (1 page) for your neighbor, including:
- Investment cost: 2.87 billion VND (according to FAST+ quotation).
- Working capital: 2-3 billion VND for electricity bill for 2-3 months.
- Expected revenue: 112.5-168.75 million VND/month (100-150 vehicles/day).
- Operating cost (excluding electricity): 75-85 million VND/month.
- Profit: 12.5-93.75 million VND/month.
- Risks: Late electricity payment, low traffic volume, high interest rate.
- Send report and discuss with your neighbor about station location and financial capacity.
- **Within 1 week**:
- Survey the station location (100-200 m², near the highway or densely populated area). Count the number of VinFast cars passing by or ask V-Green for verification.

- If the location does not reach 100 cars/day, advise the neighbor to consider another location or reduce the scale (4 stations, cost ~2 billion VND).

#### c. Independent or franchised station?

- **VinFast franchise** is a more feasible option at present because:

- Large traffic volume (100-150 cars/day), ensuring stable revenue.

- VinFast pays for electricity and supports maintenance, legal, marketing, reducing long-term risks.

- Although the profit is low (12.5-93.75 million VND/month), the cash flow is stable and less competitive than an independent station.
- **Independent stations** should only be considered if:

- The electric vehicle market is more diversified (after 2-3 years, when BYD, Hyundai grow).

- You have a large capital and are willing to invest in marketing, building a charging management application.

- The station location is near an area with many non-VinFast vehicles (HCMC, Hanoi).

---

### 5. Conclusion
- **Electricity payment mechanism**: VinFast covers the electricity cost, but you have to pay in advance 675 million - 1 billion VND/month and need 2-3 billion VND in cash for the first 2-3 months to ensure liquidity, especially if VinFast is slow to pay. This explains the broker's advice and emphasizes the importance of working capital.

- **VinFast franchise is more feasible than independent stations** because of VinFast's large market share, integrated ecosystem, and support from V-Green, despite low profit (750 VND/kWh). Independent stations have higher revenue potential but are more risky due to the small number of non-VinFast vehicles and strong competition.

- **Act now**: Contact V-Green and FAST+ to clarify the electricity refund policy and operating costs. Survey the station location and report to your neighbor within 1 week to avoid further delays.

Based on the quotation from FAST+ Charging Station Joint Stock Company and discussions on the VinFast franchise model, I analyzed the current codebase in the `manhhungdt06-charging-station/` directory and found a number of outstanding issues that need to be addressed to more accurately reflect reality and provide more reliable results to users. Below is a detailed list of issues with specific analysis:

---

### 1. The electricity payment mechanism is not modeled correctly
- **Problem**: The current code assumes that VinFast bears all the electricity costs (`monthly_electricity_cost = 0` in `calculate_payback_period`), but in reality, the partner has to pay in advance for electricity to EVN and wait for VinFast to repay after 15 days (which may be delayed). This is noted in `README.md`: *"Pay electricity bill yourself 10 days after notification date, receive electricity bill from Vin 15 days after invoice issuance"*.
- **Impact**: Failure to take into account liquidity pressure (advance payment can be up to 1 billion VND/month) and risk of delayed refund leads to inaccurate calculation of profit and payback period.
- **Details in code**: In `financial/core.py`, function `calculate_payback_period` does not include cost of advance payment for electricity or opportunity cost of this capital.
- **Improved suggestion**:
- Add parameter `working_capital` to `OperatingCosts` to model required working capital (e.g. electricity bill for 2-3 months).
- Calculate opportunity cost (loan interest or lost profit) for advance payment.
- Update `calculate_payback_period` to reflect this cost in the initial operating cost.

---

### 2. Operating costs do not fully reflect actual expenses
- **Problem**: The `OperatingCosts` class in `financial/core.py` only includes land lease (`land_lease_per_m2`), staff (`staff`), maintenance (`maintenance`), and other (`other`), but is missing items such as capacity charges, electrical infrastructure costs, or insurance.
- **Impact**: Operating costs are underestimated, causing projected profits to be higher than actual.
- **Details in code**: The default values ​​such as `staff = 10_000_000`, `maintenance = 5_000_000`, `other = 5_000_000` are fixed and do not allow for further customization of other cost items.

- **Improvement suggestions**:
- Expand `OperatingCosts` to include:

- **Electricity charge**: Based on total station power (`total_station_power_kw` in `sample.py`).

- **Insurance cost**: For equipment and civil liability.

- **Marketing cost**: To promote the charging station.

- Add input fields in the Streamlit interface (`sample.py`) for users to customize these costs.

---

### 3. Revenue from sharing with VinFast is not updated flexibly
- **Issue**: The code assumes a fixed revenue of `750 VND/kWh` (`owner_share_per_kwh` in `ElectricityPricing`), but does not take into account the free charging policy until mid-2027 or future price changes.
- **Impact**: The revenue does not reflect different periods (free or price adjustment), leading to incorrect predictions.
- **Code details**: The function `calculate_monthly_revenue` in `financial/core.py` uses a fixed value without the option to change over time.
- **Improvement suggestions**:
- Add the `revenue_share_rate` parameter to `ElectricityPricing` and allow users to adjust it in the Streamlit interface.
- Integrate phased revenue simulation (e.g. free until 2027, then market price applies).
---
### 4. Initial investment costs do not include all items
- **Problem**: The `calculate_total_investment` function in `financial/core.py` only calculates the cost of charging posts, transformers, solar energy (if any), and ground piles, but ignores items such as electrical cabinets, rack cabinets, construction costs (signboards, labor, power cables), and ancillary costs (cameras, fire extinguishers) according to the FAST+ quote.
- **Impact**: The total investment cost is underestimated, making the payback period shorter than actual.
- **Details in code**: There are only variables such as `charger_costs`, `transformer_price`, `solar_costs`, and `land_deposit`, missing additional items.
- **Improvement suggestions**:

- Expand the `calculate_total_investment` function to include:

- **Electrical cabinets and racks**.

- **Construction costs**: Labor, installation materials.

- **Ancillary costs**: Cameras, fire extinguishers, transportation.

- Add input fields in Streamlit for users to enter these costs or use default values ​​from the quote.

---

### 5. Inaccurate land area calculations
- **Problem**: The `calculate_required_area` function in `financial/core.py` assumes a simple layout (single row with one lane), but in reality, charging station layouts can be more complex depending on the number of poles and installation type.

- **Impact**: The calculated area does not reflect actual demand, affecting land rental costs.
- **Code details**: Assumptions like `total_width = spot_width * total_chargers` (for "wall" type) do not take into account factors like safety distance or space for substations.

- **Improvement suggestions**:
- Allow users to choose specific layouts (single row, double row, circle) in the Streamlit interface.

- Add safety distance and substation space parameters to the algorithm.

---

### 6. Lack of detailed risk analysis
- **Problem**: The `calculate_risk_metrics` function in `financial/core.py` only analyzes baseline scenarios (optimistic, conservative, high risk), but does not include specific risks like delayed electricity refunds or electricity price fluctuations.

- **Impact**: Users cannot fully assess actual risks.
- **Code details**: The scenarios only change `revenue_change` and basic costs, missing elements like `electricity_payment_delay`.

- **Improvement suggestions**:
- Expand risk scenarios:
- VinFast delays refunds (1-2 months).
- Electricity prices increase (10-20%).
- Vehicle traffic is lower than expected (50-70%).
- Integrate Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate profit distribution and payback period.

---

### 7. Real vehicle traffic data not yet integrated
- **Problem**: The code allows users to enter `daily_vehicles_per_pole` in `sample.py`, but there is no way to validate or estimate based on real data.

- **Impact**: Unrealistic data can lead to misleading results.
- **Details in code**: This value is just a slider without any hints from real data.

- **Improvement suggestions**:
- Integrate traffic data from V-Green or similar stations (if available).

- Add the feature to enter station locations and estimate traffic based on VinFast vehicle density in the area.

### 8. User interface is not flexible
- **Problem**: Streamlit interface in `sample.py` only allows entering the number of charging stations and some basic parameters, but does not support detailed customization of operating or investment costs.
- **Impact**: Users cannot adjust the model to suit specific situations.
- **Details in code**: The "Advanced parameters" section only includes `land_cost_per_m2`, `transformer_cost_per_kw`, etc., but lacks other cost items.
- **Improvement suggestions**:

- Expand the "Advanced parameters" section to enter details of operating costs (staff, maintenance, capacity fees).

- Add a box to enter specific investment costs from the quote.

### 9. Missing report export feature
- **Issue**: The code only displays results on the Streamlit interface without the option to export or archive the report.

- **Impact**: Users cannot save or share results for reference.

- **Code details**: There is no button or function to export a file in `sample.py`.

- **Improvement suggestions**:
- Add an "Export report" button to generate a PDF/Excel file with results, charts, and calculation details.

### 10. No comparison between franchise and independent station
- **Issue**: Code focuses on VinFast franchise model without option to compare with independent charging station.
- **Impact**: User cannot evaluate which model is more suitable.
- **Code details**: Revenue and cost are calculated based on `owner_share_per_kwh` without option to change model.
- **Improvement suggestion**:
- Add option to choose between "VinFast Franchise" and "Independent station" in Streamlit.
- For independent station, calculate revenue based on market charging price and cost including electricity.
- Show side-by-side comparison of cost, revenue, and profit.

### List of additional variables

#### 1. Variables related to the electricity payment mechanism
- **Electricity advance payment period (days)**
- The partner must pay the electricity bill to EVN within a certain period of time (usually 10 days from receipt of the bill). This variable helps calculate liquidity pressure.

- **VinFast electricity payment period (days)**
- VinFast pays the electricity bill after a period of time (e.g. 15 days), but may be late. This variable is necessary to assess the risk of delayed payment.

- **Opportunity interest rate for advance payment (%)**
- The advance payment for electricity (which can be up to billions of VND per month) creates an opportunity cost (loan interest or lost profits), which needs to be calculated.

#### 2. Variables related to operating costs
- **Electricity capacity fee (VND/kW/month)**
- Large charging stations must pay capacity fees to EVN based on the total installed capacity, which directly affects monthly operating costs.

- **Insurance costs (VND/month)**
- Equipment and civil liability insurance are important costs to protect assets and reduce legal risks.

- **Marketing costs (VND/month)**
- Advertising and promotion costs to attract customers, especially in the early stages, need to be considered.

- **Legal and licensing costs (VND)**
- Costs for legal procedures, construction permits, and fire prevention and fighting certification are initial investment costs that cannot be ignored.

#### 3. Revenue-related variables
- **Revenue sharing ratio with VinFast (VND/kWh)**
- Currently 750 VND/kWh, but needs to be flexible to reflect policy changes or separate negotiations between VinFast and partners.
- **End date of free charging policy (year)**
- Free charging policy until mid-2027 has a big impact on early-stage revenue, needs to be modeled over time.
- **Market charging price (VND/kWh)**
- Market charging price helps compare with the franchise model or evaluate profits if switching to an independent model after the contract ends.

#### 4. Risk-related variables
- **Electricity price fluctuation (%)**
- Electricity prices can increase or decrease over time, affecting operating costs if VinFast adjusts the refund policy.
- **Vehicle Traffic Fluctuation (%)**
- Vehicle charging traffic may change due to seasonality, events, or competition, which should be factored into the risk analysis.

- **Probability of delayed refund from VinFast (%)**
- The risk of VinFast delaying refunding electricity affects working capital, which should be quantified.

- **Competitive charging station density in the area**
- The number of nearby charging stations affects vehicle traffic and revenue, which should be considered in the forecast.

### Reasons for adding these variables
- **Electricity payment mechanism**: Variables such as advance payment period, repayment period, and opportunity interest rate help accurately assess financial pressure and liquidity risk.

- **Operating costs**: Capacity, insurance, marketing, and legal fees fully reflect actual costs, avoiding bias in profit calculations.
- **Revenue**: Variables on share ratio, free policy, and market price help forecast revenue flexibly and compare investment scenarios.

- **Risk**: Factors of electricity price fluctuation, traffic volume, refund delay, and competition support comprehensive risk analysis, helping users make decisions based on reliable data.

### Functions from the original codebase

- **`calculate_loan_payments`**
- **Purpose**: Calculate the monthly loan repayment schedule and interest expense based on the loan terms.

- **Points to fix**:
- Does not take into account fees arising from borrowing (such as processing fees, commitment fees).

- Lack of flexibility for special loan terms (such as grace periods, variable interest rates).

- **Solution**: Add parameters for loan fees and adjust the calculation formula to more accurately reflect the loan costs.

- **calculate_required_area`**
- **Purpose**: Calculate the land area required for a charging station based on the number of charging posts and installation type.

- **Points to fix**:
- Does not take into account the requirements for safe distances between charging posts and space for transformer stations.
- Assumes simple layout (single row with one lane), does not reflect more complex layouts.

- **Solution**: Add parameters for safety distance and auxiliary space, and allow users to select specific layouts (single row, double row, circle).

- **`calculate_monthly_revenue`**
- **Purpose**: Calculate monthly revenue from profit sharing with VinFast and additional fees.

- **Points to fix**:
- Does not take into account different phases of charging policy (such as free charging period until mid-2027).

- Fixed revenue value without the option to change over time or policy.

- **Solution**: Integrate time-based revenue simulation to reflect different phases and allow for revenue sharing ratio adjustment.

- **`calculate_total_investment`**

- **Purpose**: Calculate the total initial investment cost, including charging stations, transformers, and other items.

- **Points to fix**:

- Missing cost items such as electrical cabinets, rack cabinets, construction costs (signs, labor, power cables), and ancillary costs (cameras, fire extinguishers).

- **Solution**: Expand the function to include these costs and allow users to enter additional cost details.

- **`calculate_payback_period`**

- **Purpose**: Calculate payback period based on revenue and operating costs.

- **Points to fix**:

Does not take into account the cost of electricity advance and full operating costs (such as capacity fees, insurance).

Does not include the working capital needed to advance electricity.
- **Solution**: Update the function to include these costs and calculate the required working capital.

- **`calculate_risk_metrics`**
- **Purpose**: Analyze risks through different scenarios of revenue and costs.

- **Points to fix**:
- Specific risks such as delayed refunds from VinFast or fluctuations in electricity prices are not included.

- Current scenarios are too basic and do not fully reflect real risk factors.

- **Solution**: Expand the risk scenarios to include factors such as delayed refunds, fluctuations in electricity prices, and fluctuations in vehicle traffic.
